<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Michelle and I'm an aspiring web developer.
My interest in web development started when I took some courses in web design as part of my minor while in university. I enjoyed my web design courses and I was always interested in Javascript and more in-depth concepts that my courses didn't really go into. But these courses were not considered part of my major, so I didn't take them, and finished my degree.

Fast forward to today, and I'm self teaching myself web design and development. I'm doing this before and possibly instead of going back to school for it. As I learn more, I'm sure I'll get more clarity on what I want to focus on. For now, I'm enjoying developing these new skills I've always wanted to learn.

<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy going on walks, working out, cooking, and reading.</p>
